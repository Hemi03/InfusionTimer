# Infusion Timer

This is a tea timer app made with Flutter. Its unique feature is that it supports multiple infusions. The app comes with a defaul list of teas but you can also add your own. Many thanks to [Mei Leaf](https://meileaf.com/) for their permission to include default data from their brewing guide!
